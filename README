I wrote a quick and dirty script to strip personal info from iTunes songs. Enjoy.
This has not been tested with Python 3.x

Edit the script and put in your name, email address and file extension of your songs

Copy this script to the folder that contains your songs

From a terminal/CLI, change directory to the aforementioned folder

Run the script by typing: python strip.py



It will look for all files with the given file extension

Then, it will open each file and replace all occurences of your name and email with spaces



NOTE: PLEASE BACK UP YOUR SONGS BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG
